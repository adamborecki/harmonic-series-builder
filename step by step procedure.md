What is a harmonic series?

Nearly every single note produces multiple tones at the same time.

The harmonic series is the set of extra frequencies that are present in different notes.

Different instruments have different timbres because they have different frequencies that line up in the harmonic series.

In music, the harmonic series is comprised of multiple **partials**. Each "partial" is one "part" of the tone quality (a.k.a. timbre) of a note.

# Fundamental

## What is it?
The fundamental is the note that you hear.

## How do you "find it"?
This is the note that you hear. In homework assignments, this note is given to you.

For example, you could be trying to find a note that starts on a C.

(Or, if you want, you can pick a different note: [NOTE PICKER])

## Our fundamental is: ___
We're using: [Note Picker]

On a piano keyboard, it looks like this:

On a Grand Staff, it looks like this:

In "Note Mode", it looks like this:



# Octave
We'll build the second note by going up an octave.

## The 2nd partial
The first partial is the fundamental.

The second partial is an octave above the fundamental.

## What's our 2nd partial?
Which note comes next?

Hint: we want the same note, but an octave higher.

[NOTE PICKER]

You picked _____.

(Display this note in ):
[Piano Keyboard]
[Grand Staff]
[Note Mode]

## FYI: Overtones
The 1st tone that's over the fundamental is the 2nd part of the harmonic series.

That means, the 1st overtone = the 2nd partial.

# Perfect Fifth
The next part of the sound is a perfect fifth above the previous part.


# Major Triad

# Minor Seventh
